# Donald Trump's twitter handle for patterns. Data for this project will be
# fetched from https://www.thetrumparchive.com/. This application will be 
# reproducible. The user will be prompted to provide the year from when they 
# wish the analysis to begin.

# We will need INPUT from the user for the year to start analysis

# Get a vector containing the years (as integers) over which we are trying to
# analyze

# Download the data for these year, return it to use as a list of data frames
# Here, we get the data as a .json file

# Now combine the list of data frames into one

# Save this into the raw folder. We won't use this file at all in the analysis,
# but it will help the user get what's going on,
